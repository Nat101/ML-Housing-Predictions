# Part 1-

Download the Anchorage Municipality property inventory data set located at https://data.muni.org/Housing-and-Homelessness/CAMA-Property-Inventory-Residential-with-Details/r3di-nq2j

Produce the following results and visualizations of the raw data:

a. Histogram of the median, mean and standard deviation of housing price by year.

b. Histogram of the duration of ownership.

c. Mean bedroom count, bathroom count and garage size by year.

5. Interpret the results in a summary paragraph by providing a narrative hypothesis about the results.

# Part 2-
Using the data in the Municipality of Anchorage real estate CAMA property inventory data set perform a regression analysis and forecast the number of homes to be constructed each year for the next 10 years (2019-2029).

Use the Spark machine learning libraries to perform the analysis and produce the following results:

1. Assumptions used and factors included in the model. How did you select your hypothesis function set?

2. Table of results and bar chart showing the performance of the algorithm against the training set as well as the future predictions.

3. An assessment of the algorithm error performance.

4. A summary of the results with suggestions for  improvements.

# Part 3-  Multivariate-machine-learning-algorithm
Using the dataset in Part 2, build a multivariate machine learning algorithm with 3 additional features of your choosing. Produce a new model and predict the housing construction rates for the next 10 years.
